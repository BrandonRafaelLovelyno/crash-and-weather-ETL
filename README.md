## Problem
Like many other cities, New York City has a high number of motor vehicle accidents. Often times, these accidents occur in specific locations, at particular times, and under certain conditions.
Based on the NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset and the Open-Meteo weather API, we aim to identify the conditions where most accidents happen.
